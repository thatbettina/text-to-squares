Numbers 

-Ganze Zahlen ("integers")
-Dezimalzahlen ("floats")
We will probably mostly work with intergers.
Note: When the program calculates with integers
it rounds down.For example 9 divided by 2 will spit out 4
and not 4.5 (Makes more sense since you wouldn´t buy 4.5 
concert tickets for example)

Letters.
Letters are "strings" and can also include: 
punctuation, digits, symbols and spaces
"Hello #%^?&*@!, how are you?"


You can add strings to each other
"hello" + "everbody"
"Hello everbody"


difference between digit and number

12 is a number but
puts "1+3" will result in "1+3". because it´s in a string. 
it´s  digits, not numbers. 
puts "1" + "3"  will result in 13 (digit)
and puts 1+3 will result in 4 (number)


to get the string version of an object put .to_s after it. 

test1 = 1
test2 = "6"

puts test1.to_s + test2
result "16" (digit, not a number!)

.to_s gives the string verion
.to_i gives the integer version 
.to_f gives the float version


IF / ELSE

whatever comes betweeen the "if" and the "end" will
be executed if the "if" condition is true. 
If the user types in "Anna" (true) the computer will greet
her special. 

puts 'Hello, how are you?'
name = gets.chomp
puts 'Hello, ' + name + '.'
if name == 'Anna'
  puts 'What a lovely name!' 
end

But if we want that something else in particular should 
happen in case it´s false (it´s not Anna) we include the 
else. So it´s like 2 different possibilities, that we 
offer "Do we take the path for people whose name == 'Anna', 
or else do we take the other path?"


… to be continued.
