# cards.each do |card|
#   if rand > 0.5
#     card.known!
#   else

#   end
# end

# second option is easier:
# cards.each { |card| rand > 0.5 ? card.known! : card.unknown! }

# the third is the most elegant:
# ruby knows, that the equal sign belongs to the method-name:
cards.each { |card| card.known = rand > 0.5 }
