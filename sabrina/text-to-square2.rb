# it takes any given string of 250 characters max.
# it strips all characters that are not A-Za-z
# it downcases each character
# it assigns a color to each character (in a-z)
# it converts each instance of any character to
#   a square that has the assigned color
# it outputs a picture of 50x50 squares max.

# candidates for classes:
#
# - Square
# - Picture
# - Application
# (- String)
# (- Color)
# (- Character)

# first goal: command line application that takes a string
# and outputs a list of N color string per line, e.g.

# $ ruby text_to_squares.rb
# please enter your poem: our application is already working!
# aaaaaa bbbbbb cccccc dddddd
# eeeeee ffffff 000000 111111
#
# second goal: turn this into an actual web page using those
# css colors

require "test/unit"
require "mathn"

# The Application class ...
class Application
  # ... knows all the available colors (this is common class knowledge, so it should be a class method)
